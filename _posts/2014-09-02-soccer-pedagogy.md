I love that my son's soccer league gives pedagogical training to the parent-coaches. Things like, "recognize that you're likely to be harder on your own child than you are on the other players and deal with it accordingly." And "Another peril of coaching one's own children is leaving your coaching hat on when the game or the training is over." It's so good to have these resources.
