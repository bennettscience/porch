So many things wrong with "Pedagogy is the driver, technology is the accelerator." 

Pedagogy isn't the driver, people are. 

Digital technology isn't necessary for good pedagogy.

Valuing acceleration in ed is just another corporate fetishization of efficiency.

Sometimes tech is great for education. Sometimes we need to go slow, though. Scuba diving, not snorkeling. (HT Brian Alegant.)
