So I'm trying something new here. This is a self-hosted microblog, somewhere between Twitter and my full blog. That "between" is both in length, and in format. Posts here will likely be longer than tweets, but less publish-y than my blog posts. I find myself lately in a variety of circumstances in which I could use this kind of a format, so I'm trying it out. For now, I haven't enabled comments on the site, but I may I the future. You can always tweet at meâ€”profile linked at the top of the page.

If you would like to try something like this out yourself, feel free to ["fork" this site on GitHub](https://github.com/kshaffer/porch) and replace my posts with your own. 

Let me know what you think!
