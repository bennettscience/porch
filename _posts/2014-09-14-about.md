So I'm trying something new here. This is a self-hosted microblog, somewhere between Twitter and my full blog. That "between" is both in length, and in format. Posts here will likely be longer than tweets, but less publish-y than my blog posts.

If you would like to try something like this out yourself, feel free to ["fork" this site on GitHub](https://github.com/kshaffer/porch) and replace my posts with your own. 

Let me know what you think!
