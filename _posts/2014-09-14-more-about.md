I don't know that I'll actually stick with this, but I find myself increasingly desirous of a platform that is both longer and slower-to-disappear than Twitter, but that is not so article-like as my blog has become.

This is my "porch," as Frank Chimero calls it. My place for bouncing ideas around leisurely in a (mostly) non-hostile and (hopefully) troll-free environment.
